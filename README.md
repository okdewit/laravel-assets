# [laravel-assets](http://roumen.it/projects/laravel-assets) package

A simple assets manager for Laravel 5 (...and 6? and 7?)

## Notes

This is a fork of the archived https://github.com/Laravelium/laravel-assets repository, for the purpose of making it compatible with newer Laravel versions.

To install, add this repository to your composer:

```
{
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/okdewit/laravel-assets"
}
```

And require `"roumen/asset": "^3.0"`.
